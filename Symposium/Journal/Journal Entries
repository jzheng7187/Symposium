Started to look up how to make animations. I also started to look up sprite sheets. However, I need to make sure I am 
able to use the sprite sheets, so I started looking for the license.
For Tomorrow: I need to finish researching animations and start coding. Also I need to remember to copy the GUI Application 
from the introduction file
