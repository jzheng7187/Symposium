Goal: finish the submission and try to think of a concrete idea
For Tomorrow: Think of a final idea and start doing research and programming the product

5/5/17
Started to look up how to make animations. I also started to look up sprite sheets. However, I need to make sure I am 
able to use the sprite sheets, so I started looking for the license.
For Tomorrow: I need to finish researching animations and start coding. Also I need to remember to copy the GUI Application 
from the introduction file

5/8/17
Finished: I copied the code for the GUI. I also started making the other screens,but there were complications with the colors. 
I also continued research on animations. I think that I should concentrate on one thing at a time, aka the front end first. 
For Tomorrow: Fix the problem I had today.

Today was a short day. However, I started to look at how to utilize the arrow keys on the game. I also started to look at sprite 
sheets. There is also the fact that I started to think of what kind of Listeners I need to use so that my program will work.

5/10/17
Today I made my 2 screens connect and I will continue to research some stuff for animations. I decided to change from having 
KeyListeners on the introduction screen and made it so that the game screen is the one that utilizes the KeyListeners.

5/11/17
Today I found an image for the intro screen. But I didn't know how to utilize it. So I took a suggestion from Hunter to make a 
Background class, so that I can utilize the background. Using this method, however, will make it so that the background would be 
in the front and not in the back like it is intended to.

5/15/17
I made some new classes, but I had to use a new computer because I wasn't able to get the data from my previous one to work. 

5/16/17
Today I had to work on github, becuase I was unable to get my code from github into Eclipse. I added some classes to make it so that 
the sprites, not yet to be added, can move. I might have to copy everything and change my repository if I want to work on eclipse.

5/17/17
I'm just going to make a new repository

5/22/17
I helped Alex with his code

5/23/17
I made some more code

5/24/17
uh...so I made a new class for when it's GameOver. I decided to restart all my research on how to continue this project.

5/25/17
I started to look up sprites for the characters that are going to be used in my game.

5/26/17
I started to add some more code to my classes,especially the enemy class. The problem with the sprites right now is that 
the website I was using got shut down, but there is a downloaded version. I'm going to downlaod the program and continue 
making sprites for my program.

5/30/17
I have uploaded the sprites for the enemy and added the background for the game screen. I am starting to animate the 
enemy so that it can move across the screen independently from the player. I will upload the 
player sprite, so that i can be able to move that object across the screen.

6/1/17
I continued to look at daniel goon's code as an example of how to code my game. I might have to seek advice from him from 
time to time.

6/2/17
i continued to add some code to the player class and the enemy class. I also made it incorporate a third screen of when the 
player loses by losing their health.

6/5/17
I added some code to the enemy class and the player class. I need it to incorporate score.

6/6/17
I added some more code to the GUI. I also started to fix some code within the Player, Enemy and the 
GameScreen class.
