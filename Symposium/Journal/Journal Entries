Started to look up how to make animations. I also started to look up sprite sheets. However, I need to make sure I am 
able to use the sprite sheets, so I started looking for the license.
For Tomorrow: I need to finish researching animations and start coding. Also I need to remember to copy the GUI Application 
from the introduction file

Finished: I copied the code for the GUI. I also started making the other screens,but there were complications with the colors. 
I also continued research on animations. I think that I should concentrate on one thing at a time, aka the front end first. 
For Tomorrow: Fix the problem I had today.
